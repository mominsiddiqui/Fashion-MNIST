# Fashion-MNIST
We build a model for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset. We used 60,000 images for training (55k training and 5k validation) and 10,000 images for testing. 

Having tested various models, a shallow convolutional neural network gave us the best accuracy for test set.

# Our test set accuracy is 93.05%
